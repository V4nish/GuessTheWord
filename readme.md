### My attempt at the published WJEC "Guess the Word" problem. ###

This is an advisory attempt at how one might BEGIN to attempt the WJEC Computer Science [Guess the Word](http://www.wjec.co.uk/qualifications/computer-science/computer-science-gcse/GCSE%20Controlled%20Assessment%202017-2018.zip?language_id=1) controlled assessment.

It's actually a rather lame, poor and incomplete attempt; the code is not commented thoroughly, there is little (read: no) validation.  This code is left here for future generations to see how to START solving such a problem and how such a problem might BEGIN to be tackled.

If you submitted this as your entry:

A) You're an idiot, because it'll be picked up by the automated systems, moderators and examiners as a COPY!!!!!
B) Even if you just changed a few things and managed to bypass issue (A), then you'd barely scrape a passing grade if you were lucky!
C) You're in breach of not just ethics, but the license agreement!!

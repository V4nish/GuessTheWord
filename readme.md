### My attempt at the WJEC "Guess the Word" problem. ###

This is an educational attempt at how one might BEGIN to attempt the WJEC Computer Science [Guess the Word](http://www.wjec.co.uk/qualifications/computer-science/computer-science-gcse/GCSE%20Controlled%20Assessment%202017-2018.zip?language_id=1) controlled assessment.  As a student CS teacher, I'm keen to understand how students may approach the problem, so this product is based **largely on my observations of students interpretations, following other teachers lessons** and will allow me to ***reflect and inform my own teaching practice***.

It's actually a rather lame, poor and incomplete attempt; the code is not commented thoroughly enough at all, there is little (read: no real) validation.  This code is a ***starting point ONLY*** intended for my own personal use only.

If you were to try and take this and submit this code:

* You're an idiot, because it'll be picked up by the automated systems, moderators and examiners as a COPY!!!!!
* Even if you changed just enough to fool the above, and managed to bypass copy detection, then you'd barely scrape a passing grade if you were lucky!  THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT - do your own work!
* You're in breach of not just ethics, but the license agreement!!

This "software" product is offered under [Phil Sturgeon's rather excellent DBAD license](https://github.com/philsturgeon/dbad), so use it as an educational teaching tool ONLY, and DBAD!
